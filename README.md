- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jdlewis73
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in creating a comic book database that will enable me to track not only the books I have in my possession, but also the books that I have bought but am awaiting shipment from online sources.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning GitHub ;)   But also SQL and anything else that will enable me to complete this
